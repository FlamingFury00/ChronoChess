# Requirements Document

## Introduction

ChronoChess is an idle-autobattler chess hybrid that combines traditional chess mechanics with idle progression systems, narrative encounters, and advanced 3D visualization. Players develop evolving pieces through resource management, experience matches as story-driven encounters, and unlock reality-bending chess mechanics through sophisticated visual effects and physics simulations.

The game monetizes through aesthetic enhancements while maintaining fair play, offering a unique blend of strategic depth, idle progression, and visual spectacle that appeals to both casual and hardcore players.
